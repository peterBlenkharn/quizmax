    "choices": ["14", "15", "16", "18"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values: 18 - 4 = 14."

  {
    "question": "A survey of 100 people found that 60 people prefer coffee over tea. What is the probability that a randomly selected person prefers coffee?",
    "choices": ["0.4", "0.5", "0.6", "0.7"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The probability is the number of people who prefer coffee divided by the total number of people: 60/100 = 0.6."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the standard deviation measure in a dataset?",
    "choices": ["The average value", "The variability in the data", "The central tendency", "The range of the data"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Standard deviation measures how much the data values differ from the mean, reflecting the data's variability."

    "question": "In a probability experiment, events A and B are independent. If P(A) = 0.5 and P(B) = 0.4, what is P(A and B)?",
    "choices": ["0.20", "0.90", "0.70", "0.10"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.5 × 0.4 = 0.20."

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "There are 4 Aces in a 52-card deck, so the probability is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13."

    "choices": ["15", "10", "25", "35"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "IQR is calculated as Q3 - Q1 = 25 - 10 = 15."

    "question": "What is a probability distribution?",
    "choices": [
      "A function that describes all the possible outcomes with their probabilities",
      "A measure of central tendency",
      "A type of statistical graph",
      "A summary statistic"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "A probability distribution is a function that assigns probabilities to all possible outcomes of a random experiment."

    "question": "A coin is flipped 4 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?",
    "choices": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1/8"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Using the binomial formula: C(4,3)=4, and the total outcomes are 2⁴ = 16. So the probability is 4/16 = 1/4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which measure of central tendency is most affected by extreme values?",
    "choices": ["Mean", "Median", "Mode", "Interquartile Range"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and can be skewed by them."

    "choices": ["2/15", "4/15", "1/5", "2/10"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The probability for the first white ball is 4/10 and then 3/9 for the second white ball. Multiply them: (4/10) × (3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15."
